# Hi 👋, I'm Mohammed Samgan Khan

## A passionate Developer from India

Talking about me, I excel at solving complex problems involving logic and step by step breakdown of the problem. Besides, to develop complex algorithms, I specialize in problem framing, systems design, and product development strategy. Sometimes I also enjoy public speaking.  

I am also the creator of penit.ink, a site which provides young writers with a free hand place to show their creation to the world. Irrespective of the niche, if you write this place is defiantly for you.
